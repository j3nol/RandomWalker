# Random Walker Simulation

This Java program simulates multiple random walkers moving within a bounded area. Each walker moves randomly in four directions (up, down, left, right) at each step, and their positions are updated periodically to create a dynamic simulation.

## How to Run

To run the Random Walker simulation, you need to have Java installed on your system.

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `RandomWalker.java` file using a Java compiler. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


3. Run the compiled program by executing the following command:


4. The simulation window will appear, showing multiple black circles representing the random walkers. They will move around randomly within the window boundaries.

## Program Description

- Each walker starts at the center of the simulation area.
- At each step, each walker randomly chooses one of four directions (up, down, left, right) and moves in that direction by a fixed step size.
- The program ensures that the walkers stay within the boundaries of the simulation area.
- The simulation continues indefinitely until you close the window.

## About Random Walkers

Random walks are mathematical processes where a variable moves randomly from one position to another. They have applications in various fields, including physics, biology, finance, and computer science.
