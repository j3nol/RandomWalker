# <span style="font-size:larger;">**Random Walker**</span>


Random Walker is a simple Java program that simulates multiple random walkers moving within a bounded area. Each walker moves randomly in one of four directions (up, down, left, or right) at regular intervals, creating an animated effect.

**Features**

Simulates multiple random walkers moving independently.
Walkers are displayed as circles on a graphical user interface (GUI).
Periodic updates redraw the GUI to reflect the new positions of the walkers.
Walkers cannot move beyond the boundaries of the display area.

**Getting Started**

To run the Random Walker program, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Download the RandomWalker.java file.


Compile the Java file using the following command:

**javac RandomWalker.java**


Run the compiled program with the following command:

**java RandomWalker**

**Usage**

Once the program is running, you'll see a window titled "Random Walkers" displaying the animated movement of multiple circles representing the walkers. The walkers move randomly within the confines of the window.

**Customization**

You can customize the behavior of the program by adjusting the following parameters in the RandomWalker class:

**WIDTH and HEIGHT**: Set the dimensions of the display area.


**STEP_SIZE**: Define the distance each walker moves in each step.


**NUM_WALKERS**: Specify the number of walkers to simulate.


**Dependencies**

The Random Walker program uses Swing for the graphical user interface.
